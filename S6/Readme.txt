This is a readme file for assignment 6 of EVA4.

This is how I tested my model with various combinations. Refer to the uploaded github image (Oberservations.png).

First I tried removing dropout from the model to see the actual effects of L1, L2 and L1&L2.

The referred image is a metric which shows may be minimal but key points/observations.
